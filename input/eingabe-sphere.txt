#
# 1. coordinate of the center (3 double values)
# 2. number of particles for the radius (1 int value)
# 3. distance h of the particles (mesh width of the grid) (1 double value)
# 4. mass m of one particle (1 double value)
# 5. initial velocity of the particles (3 double values)
# 6. mean-value of the velocity of the brownian motion (1 double value)
