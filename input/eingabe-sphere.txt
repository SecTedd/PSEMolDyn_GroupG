$Sph
# This is a sphere input file 
#
# file format: 
# The first line needs to be '$Sph' so the input logic knows its a sphere file 
#
# Lines of comment start with '#' and are only allowed at the beginning of the file after the '$Sph'
# Empty lines are not allowed.
# 
# After the comments the six paramters must follow in the order: 
#
# 1. coordinate of the center (3 double values)
# 2. number of particles for the radius (1 int value)
# 3. distance h of the particles (mesh width of the grid) (1 double value)
# 4. mass m of one particle (1 double value)
# 5. initial velocity of the particles (3 double values)
# 6. epsilon value for the Lennard Jones force
# 7. sigma value for the Lennard Jones force
# 8. Type for the particles, used for displaying different colors (1 int value)
# 9. Indicator for stationary sphere (1 int value where 0 means false and 1 means true)
